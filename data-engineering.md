# Questions

## How do you define structured and unstructured data?

Structured data is usually found in relational databases with clearly defined data types having patterns that make them easily searchable.

On the other hand unstructured data is comprised of data that is usually not as easily searchable, including formats such as audio, video, and socal media postings.

## What makes a database relational?

A database having a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them makes a database relational. Such database tables could contain foreign keys which could be used to link to other tables using their primary key.

## Functional Programming or OOP?

Both software paradigms can be used well or poorly, so a lot of it just comes down to the developer's ability to exploit their features and the rest just depends on the domain you're trying to model.

For instance, if that domain deals with a bunch of things that look and interact like objects, then OOP will probably be better; if it's mostly a complex, abstract computation, functional would be better.

## What is serverless?

Serverless computing is a form of abstraction where the backend services are managed on an as-used basis on behalf of developers, allowing them to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## What is distributed processing?

Involves simultaniously running an application/task on multiple processors to increase performance.

## What is CSV? When would you use this file type?

A Comma Separated Value file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. It is fast to write, but slow to read.

It is very easy to comprehehend for both usders and computers and made more accessible via Microsoft Excel.

## What is JSON? When would you use this file type?

JavaScript Object Notation is the standard for communicating on the web.

APIs and websites are constantly communicating using JSON thanks to its usability properties such as well-defined schemas.

## What is Parqet? When would you use this file type?

Parquet is a binary format containing metadata about its contents and is optimised for the Write Once Read Many (WORM) paradigm.

It is slow to write, but incredibly fast to read, especially when accessing subsets.

## How do you describe denormalised data?

Denormalised data is used as a database optimisation technique by adding redundantcopies of data to one or more tables to improve read performance at the cost of write performance.

## What are the steps to build a DWH?

1. Gather business requirements
2. Identify sources
3. Identify facts
4. Define dimensions
5. Define attributes
6. Redefine dimensions and/or attributes
7. Organise attribute hierarchy
8. Define relationship
9. Assign unique identifiers

## What is IaC?

Infrastructure as code is the management of infrastructure through both human and machine readable definition files rather than hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

## What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration and Development refers to a method that automates stages of app development to frequently deliver apps to customers.

## What is TDD?

Test Driven Development involves converting software requirements into test cases before the software is fully deployed. Assuming code coverage is high and all test cases are passing, software can safely be deployed to production.

## What is a distributed cache?

A distributed cache supplements a primary database by removing unnecessary presure on it, typically in the form of frequently accessed read data. In this case, the cache spans multiple servers rather than a single locale.

## What are Functional and Non-Functional testing?

Both are testing methodologies meant to ensure that software can successfully operate in multiple environments across different platforms.

Functional tests involve testing the application against the business requirements, while non-function tests focus on the operational aspects of a piece of software.

## What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline contains workflows with the aim of automating the movement and transformation of data based on business logic.

## What is containerisation?

Bundling software code with all its necessary components into an isolated container to reproduce the evironment required to run on any system.

## What is orchestration?

Automates numerous tasks such as data extraction and transformation which may run at the same time.

## What is NoSQL?

Databases built for specific non-tabular data models having flexible schemas.
